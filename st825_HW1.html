<h5>Brief History</h5>			<!-- title for the paragraph -->
<p>In mathematics, the Fibonnacci sequence is where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. The sequence is as follows: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13.... and so on. Fibonacci numbers are named after Leonardo of Pisa who was an Italian mathematician and later came to be known as Fibonacci. Fibonacci discovered this sequence based on a problem involving rabbits. The problem, dealing with the regeneration of rabbits, calculated the number of rabbbits after a year if there is only one pair the first month. The problem states that it takes one month for a rabbits pair to mature, and the pair will then produce one pair of rabbits each following. When the total number of rabbits for each month was listed, it generated the Fibonacci sequence of numbers. A closer look at the numbers making up the Fibonacci sequence brings to light all sorts of fascinating patterns and mathematical properties. Several hundred years after Fibonacci's lifetime, the time of the Renaissance emerged, when people began to pay more analytical attention to the natural world surrounding them. As they studied the structures and forms of various plants, animals, and humans, they noticed that Fibonacci number patterns were showing up in measurements throughout creation such as in plants, animals, architecture, art, and music.</p>
